Regular Expressions are used to match different combinations of character string
s
within files and data streams. Regular Expressions are composed of two types:
1-	literal characters
	(these characters are the common characters we use every day. They are
	characters such as 5, A, @, etc. They mean what they are seen as.)
2-	Meta characters (magic)
	(these characters represent or more other characters and can match one o
r
	more ASCII characters, aside from their own value.)

These are two types of characters can be combined to match strings such as:
1- the word "market", but only at the start of a line (^\<market\>)
2- empty lines(^$)
3- the string market (string)
4- any possible combination of b or B followed by any number of any characters
   followed by gates or Gates ([bb].*[gG]ates).

Regular expressions are sometimes mixed up with Command Line Metacharacters
which serve a similar function, but with different magical characters, and for
matching filenames at command line. The ability to to effectively use Regular
Expressions can signicantly incres the power that a user has when searching
for character strings with files.
